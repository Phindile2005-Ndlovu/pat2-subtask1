What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method of encoding textual information using a series of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It allows for communication through sound, light, or visual signals.

 Historical Context

Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by **Samuel Morse** and **Alfred Vail** as a means of long-distance communication. It was originally designed for use with the electric telegraph, a device that transmitted messages over wires using electrical pulses. 

The first successful telegraph line using Morse code was established in 1844 between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. The first official message sent was “**What hath God wrought**”.

 How Does Morse Code Work?

Morse code represents each character (letter or number) with a unique combination of **dots (`.`)** and **dashes (`-`)**:

- A dot is a short signal.
- A dash is a long signal (typically three times longer than a dot).

For example:
- A = `.−`
- B = `−...`
- C = `−.−.`

Words are separated by a space, and letters within words are separated by short pauses (or spaces, when written).

Morse code can be transmitted in various forms:
- Audibly (beeps)
- Visually (light flashes)
- Physically (taps)
